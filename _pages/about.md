I'm a first year PHD student from [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai JiaoTong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes medical AI, computer vision. I am currently supervised by [Prof. Jin Cheng](https://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/Web/FacultyDetail/913) from School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University.

The homework is listed below: And the video I watch is [The Inside Story of ChatGPT’s Astonishing Potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_78DM8fG6E&t=323s)

My research focus is related to deep learning, and the trend towards large models is currently unstoppable. The driving force behind this wave is the development of ChatGPT by OpenAI. Consequently, I discovered a presentation by Greg Brockman, the co-founder of OpenAI, at a TED talk entitled "The Inside Story of ChatGPT’s Astonishing Potential." In his talk, he demonstrated numerous examples of using GPT-4 live and briefly explained the training logic behind ChatGPT. After the presentation, Chris Anderson, the CEO of TED, engaged in a discussion with him about various issues arising from ChatGPT.
Greg Brockman's presentation was incredibly engaging, providing me with a deeper understanding of the formidable capabilities of GPT-4. His method of showcasing his research focus was through live demonstrations; they used a plethora of live demos to let the audience intuitively experience the power of ChatGPT. I believe this is also one of the most effective ways to present engineering research. Rather than explaining dry principles to the public, it is the demonstration of results that truly encourages the public to engage with your research. This embodies the principle of "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." Starting with the prompt "suggest a nice post-TED meal," Greg used ChatGPT-related plugins to sequentially complete four tasks: providing text suggestions, drawing images that came to mind, generating a shopping list and related shopping links based on the suggestions, and sending the content to Twitter. These tasks did not require humans to explicitly define the desired outcome; they were all accomplished by related plugins, such as DALL-E 2, which aligns with the first element of his talk. Their research has created tools for AI, not humans, and AI has the ability to use tools just like humans. When explaining how to train ChatGPT, Greg used concise language and vivid examples to describe the training process of ChatGPT: starting with a large amount of data for unsupervised training, allowing AI to learn various relevant skills, while introducing some supervised tasks to reinforce the AI's generation of correct answers through human judgment, that is, teaching AI to use skills. Finally, Greg cited the example of using GPT-4 to treat pets alongside a doctor, emphasizing the purpose of the ChatGPT tool: through collaboration between humans and AI, some unprecedented results can be created, and humans can also provide valuable supervision for AI, allowing general artificial intelligence to benefit all of humanity. However, I believe there were some flaws in Greg's presentation. For example, his speaking pace was noticeably faster than other TED speakers, which could make it difficult for some to keep up. Additionally, in the part of the presentation where he discussed human-AI collaboration, Greg demonstrated the function of analyzing tables, which I believe was not as closely related to the main topic. Greg should have offered a more in-depth discussion after the demonstration.
If I were to participate in this lecture, I could contribute relevant live demonstrations. Within the organization of the talk, I would first succinctly narrate the purpose behind the development of ChatGPT as well as the complex sentiments that people currently harbor towards ChatGPT, and clarify that the theme of the lecture is to showcase ChatGPT's capabilities and how it arrives at its conclusions. Then, like Greg, I would demonstrate ChatGPT's capabilities through live demonstrations. Next, I would briefly explain what "GPT" stands for. I believe that even in a science popularization context, it is necessary to convey some fundamental concepts to the audience; otherwise, they might leave the lecture without understanding the difference and connection between ChatGPT and GPT-4. Subsequently, I would provide a concise introduction to how ChatGPT is developed (i.e., trained). The Teacher-Student concept is excellent, and I would continue to use it, but compared to the original talk, I would describe some concepts in more detail, as I feel the original presentation was somewhat vague on certain concepts. Finally, I would still use the pet treatment example to conclude, emphasizing the pivotal role of humans in the context of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is merely a tool, and we need to use it wisely.
